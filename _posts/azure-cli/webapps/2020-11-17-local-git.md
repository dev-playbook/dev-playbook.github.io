## **Introduction**

{{page.description}}
{%include az-cli/000-prerequisites.md%}
- git cli

## **Prepare**
{%include az-cli/005-login-account.md%}
{% include az-cli/010-create-resource-group.md %}

## **Create Web App**

{% include az-cli/020-create-app-service.md sku="F1"%}

{% include az-cli/030-create-webapp-nodejs.md%}

{% include az-cli/040-browse-webapp.md %}

    Expect to see a placeholder page for NodeJS apps.

## **Deploy Source**

1. **[Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)** this GitHub repository and change working folder.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/dev-playbook/nodejs-env-request-vars

    cd ./nodejs-env-request-vars
    ```

{% include az-cli/070-get-site-level-creds.md %}

1. Get the site-level credentials for deployment.

    ```shell
    username=$(az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --query publishingUserName | sed -e 's/["\r ]//g')
    echo $username

    password=$(az webapp deployment list-publishing-credentials --query publishingPassword | sed -e 's/["\r ]//g')
    echo $password
    ```

    >Alternatively, you can use <u>user-level credentials</u> are directly tied to your Microsoft Account. This is global to all your Azure Web Apps and you only need to set this once. However, the <u>username has to be globally unique to all accounts in Azure</u>. You create or reset the user credentials by executing the following with the appropriate _{username}_ and _{password}_.
    >```
    >az webapp deployment user set --user-name '{username}' --password '{password}'
    >```

1. Detach the GitHub remote repository and attach Azure's remote repository.

    ```shell
    git remote remove origin

    repoUrl=https://$username:$password@$appname.scm.azurewebsites.net/$appname.git
    echo $repoUrl

    git remote add origin $repoUrl
    ```
    Note the site-credentials are included in the repository Url.
    >The remote repository is provided by the [Kudu Source Control Manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/videos/what-is-kudu-with-david-ebbo/). Excluding the username and password from the Url will result in the command line asking for your credentials.

    >To confirm remote repository attachment to git configuration.
    >```
    >git config -l | grep remote.origin
    >```

1. Push to the remote git repository.

    ```shell
    git branch master
    git checkout master
    git push --set-upstream origin master
    ```
    Expect messaged to include a successful build and deployment.
    Note that deployment is triggered from the <code>master</code> branch and not from the <code>main</code> branch.

1. Confirm the deployment was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a '_Hello World from Version 1_' header and a list of key-value pairs from the environment variables and the HTTP request.

## **Continuous Deployment of Source Changes**

1. Execute the following to change the header message of the NodeJS app.

    ```shell
    # change message to Version 2 from Version 1
    cp ./app.js ./app.js.old
    (cat ./app.js.old) | sed -e 's/Version 1/Version 2/g' > app.js

    # commit changes
    git add ./app.js
    git commit -m 'updated to Version 2'
    git push
    ```
    Expect messages indicating a successful deployment.

1. Confirm the deployment of the source changes was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a header message **'Hello World from Version 2'**.
