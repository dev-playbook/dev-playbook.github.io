## **Introduction**
{{ page.description }} **Note that the process requires upgrading to the chargeable [Basic Service Plan for Linux](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/pricing/details/app-service/linux/){:target="_blank"}**.

To complete the tutorial, you will need the following.

- bash terminal
- Azure CLI installed
- A personal Azure Account

## **Preperations**

1. Complete the _[introductory tutorial]({% link _posts/azure-cli/webapps/2020-11-15-introduction.md %})_ excluding Clean Up.

1. Confirm the NodeJS app is deployed and running.
    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```

1. Confirm the default arguments to <code>az</code> command for _group_ and _web_ are configured.
    ```shell
    az configure --list-defaults --output table
    ```

## **Scaling Up**

1. Confirm the app service plan has an F1 SKU
    ```shell
    planId=$(az webapp show --query appServicePlanId | sed -e s/\"//g)
    az appservice plan show --ids $planId --query sku
    ```
    Expect the following payload in return.
    ```json
    {
        "capabilities": null,
        "capacity": 1,
        "family": "F",
        "locations": null,
        "name": "F1",
        "size": "F1",
        "skuCapacity": null,
        "tier": "Free"
    }
    ```

1. Upgrade the app service plan to Basic Service Plan SKU.

    ```shell
    az appservice plan update --ids $planId --sku B1
    ```
    Expect the resulting payload to include the following in the <code>"sku"</code> section.
    ```json
    {
        "capabilities": null,
        "capacity": 1,
        "family": "B",
        "locations": null,
        "name": "B1",
        "size": "B1",
        "skuCapacity": null,
        "tier": "Basic"
    }
    ```
    > Basic a is production-grade tier for low traffic requirements. It has the following features and limitations.
    > - Uses _dedicated virtual machines_ allowing scaling out to multiple instances.
    > - Limited to _manual scaling_.
    > - Allows for _customised domains_ and the use of _ssl certificates_
    > - _No deployment slots_ for staging environments.

1. Confirm that the site still works and stream the logs.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse --logs
    ```

## **Clean up**

1. Delete all resources created in the group, including the web app and app service.

    ```shell
    az group delete --yes
    ```
