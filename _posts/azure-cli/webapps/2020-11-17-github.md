## **Introduction**

This tutorial takes the 
 _[introduction to Azure Web Apps]({% link _posts/azure-cli/webapps/2020-11-15-introduction.md %})_ further by showing how to manually deploy changes from a public repository in GitHub, and switch over to continuous deployment.

To complete the tutorial, you will need the following.

- bash terminal
- Azure CLI installed
- A personal Azure Account
- A GitHub account
- git cli

## **Preperations**

1. Ensure that you are logged in to your Azure Account

    ```shell
    az account show
    # if not, login
    az login
    ```

1. Create a resource group in West UK where the web app will be deployed.

    ```shell
    rg='webapp-demo-rg'
    location='ukwest'
    az group create --name $rg --location $location --verbose
    ```

1. Configure the Azure CLI to use default arguments.
    
    ```shell
    az configure --defaults group=$rg location=$location
    az configure --list-defaults --output table
    ```
    The configured defaults should include values for _group_ and _location_. From here on, subsequent <code>az</code> commands will omit arguments for <code>--resource-group</code> and <code>--location</code>.

## **Creation**

1. Create an Azure App Service Plan with FREE pricing tier in the Linux platform

    ```shell
    planname='webapp-demo-asplan'
    az appservice plan create --name $planname --sku FREE --is-linux --verbose
    ```
    Results should include details of the new service plan, including its Id, SKU details and provisioning state as _Succeeded_.

1. Create a web app using the service plan with a unique name and NodeJs runtime.
    
    ```shell
    appname="webapp-demo-app-$RANDOM"
    az webapp create --name $appname --plan $planname --runtime "node|12-lts" --verbose
    ```
    Results should include details of the new web app.

1. Add the app name as a default argument to Azure CLI.
    
    ```shell
    az configure --defaults web=$appname
    az configure --list-defaults --output table
    ```
    The defaults should include a value for _web_. From here on, subsequent <code>az</code> commands will omit arguments for <code>--resource-group</code>, <code>--location</code> and <code>--name</code> (of web app).

1. Open the web app and expect a placeholder page.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```

## **Source Deployment**

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) this repository to your own GitHub account.

    https://github.com/dev-playbook/nodejs-env-request-vars

1. Configure the source of the deployment to the _main_ branch of your GitHub repository.

    ```shell
    repourl="https://github.com/{your-git-username}/nodejs-env-request-vars.git"
    az webapp deployment source config --repo-url $repourl --branch main --manual-integration --verbose
    ```

    The <code>--manual-integration</code> specifies no continuous deployment of source changes.

1. Confirm the deployment was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a '_Hello World from Version 1_' header and a list of key-value pairs from the environment variables and the HTTP request.

## **Manual Deployment of Source Changes**

1. Execute the following from a working folder to change the header message of the NodeJS app.

    ```shell
    # clone github repository
    git clone https://github.com/{your-git-username}/nodejs-env-request-vars.git
    cd ./nodejs-env-request-vars

    # change message to Version 2 from Version 1
    cp ./app.js ./app.js.old
    (cat ./app.js.old) | sed -e 's/Version 1/Version 2/g' > app.js

    # commit changes
    git add ./app.js
    git commit -m 'updated to Version 2'
    git push
    ```

    > Alternatively, you can make the changes [directly from GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/editing-files-in-your-repository).

1. Deploy source changes.

    ```shell
    az webapp deployment source sync --verbose
    ```

    Note that you may have to wait for a couple of minutes for the deployment to complete.

1. Confirm the deployment of the source changes was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a header message **'Hello World from Version 2'**.

1. Analyse the deployment logs

    ```shell
    az webapp log deployment list
    ```
    Expect to see 2 log entries, one per deployment. The last deployment refers is the flagged _active_ and refers to the latest.

## **Continuous Deployment**

1. From the cloned repository folder, execute the following to change the header message of the NodeJS app to Version 3.

    ```shell
    # change message to Version 3 from Version 1
    (cat ./app.js.old) | sed -e 's/Version 1/Version 3/g' > app.js

    # commit changes
    git add ./app.js
    git commit -m 'updated to Version 3'
    git push
    ```

1. From your GitHub account, [obtain a personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token){:target="_blank"} with ONLY the following permissions granted.

    ```
    write:repo_hook
    read:repo_hook
    ```

1. Update the deployment source config to use a git token

    ```shell
    az webapp deployment source delete --verbose

    az webapp deployment source config --repo-url $repourl --branch main --git-token {personal access token} --verbose
    ```

    Note that deleting the previous configuration is necessary in order to remove <code>--manual-integration</code>. Consequently, previous deployment logs will be lost.

1. Confirm the deployment of the source changes was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a header message **'Hello World from Version 3'**.

1. From the cloned repository folder, execute the following to change the header message of the NodeJS app to Version 4.

    ```shell
    # change message to Version 3 from Version 1
    (cat ./app.js.old) | sed -e 's/Version 1/Version 4/g' > app.js

    # commit changes
    git add ./app.js
    git commit -m 'updated to Version 4'
    git push
    ```

1. Await for a couple of minutes, then confirm the automated deployment of the source change was successful.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```
    Expect the results to include a header message **'Hello World from Version 4'**.

1. Analyse the deployment logs

    ```shell
    az webapp log deployment list
    ```
    Expect to see 2 log entries, one per deployment. Note that log entries under --manual-integration are not included as they were lost from the config changes. The last deployment refers is the flagged _active_ and refers to the latest source change.

## **Clean up**

1. Delete all resources created in the group, including the web app and app service.

    ```shell
    az group delete --yes
    ```
1. You may also want to revoke the personal access token from GitHub.
