## **Introduction**
{{page.description}}

To complete the tutorial, you will need the following.

- bash terminal
- Azure CLI installed
- A personal Azure Account

## **Preperations**

1. Complete either the _[introductory]({% link _posts/azure-cli/webapps/2020-11-15-introduction.md %})_ or [GitHub deployment]({% link _posts/azure-cli/webapps/2020-11-17-github.md %}) tutorial excluding Clean Up.

1. Confirm the NodeJS app is deployed and running.
    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```

1. Confirm the default arguments to <code>az</code> command for _group_ and _web_ are configured.
    ```shell
    az configure --list-defaults --output table
    ```

1. Ensure that variable $appname has the value of the web app's name.

    ```shell
    [[ -z "$appname" ]] && appname=$(az webapp show --query "name" | sed -e s/\"//g)
    ```

## **Deployment History**

1. View the deployment history of the web app.

    ```shell
    az webapp log deployment list
    ```
    The result is a trail of the web app's deployment history with the top entry being the most recent. The _active_ deployment is the most recent and successful deployment. Each entry has the following useful information.

    - <code>id</code> is the _deployment id_ and is the same as the git's _commit id_.
    - <code>message</code> is the comment taken from git commit.
    - <code>url</code> is a link to same entry.
    - <code>log_url</code> is a link to the logs of this deployment.
    - <code>status</code> 4 is a successful deployment, 3 is failure, 1 is pending

    > Alternatively, you can also view the deployment logs by navigate to the Deployments page in Kudu Source Control Manager.
    > ```
    > xdg-open https://$appname.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/deployments
    > ```

1. To access the log entries of a deployment, you have the following options.

    + View log of the latest deployment
    ```shell
    az webapp log deployment show
    ```
    + View log of any deployment by its deployment id
    ```shell
    az webapp log deployment show --deployment-id {deploymentId}
    ```
    + View log using its <code>log_url</code> from the deployment history.

    The following are typical log entries of a successful deployment.

        Updating submodules.
        Preparing deployment for commit id '{git commit id}'.
        Repository path is /home/site/repository
        Running oryx build...                           
        Running post deployment command(s)...
        Triggering recycle (preview mode disabled).
        Deployment successful.

    Each log entry may have its own log entries accessible thru its <code>details_url</code>, such as <code>Running oryx build...</code>.

## **Log Dump**

1. Download all activity logs of the web app.

    ```shell
    az webapp log download
    ```
    Expect to find <code>_webapp_logs.zip_</code> on your current working directory. It should contain all of the deployment and docker container logs, and trace files from Kudu and Web Secure Shell.

    If you view the latest <code>*_docker.log</code> file in <code>/LogFiles</code>, expect INFO messages saying _'Logging is not enabled for this container'_. This indicates web server logs are not being stored and therefore are not included in the log dump.

## **Storing Web Server Logs**

1. View the web server log stream.

    ```shell
    az webapp log tail
    ```
    From here you should see the log entries from the web server including _'Hello World'_ messages.

1. View the web apps logging configuration.

    ```shell
    az webapp log show
    ```
    Expect to see this as part of the payload.
    ```json
    "httpLogs": {
      "azureBlobStorage": {
        "enabled": false,
        "retentionInDays": 3,
        "sasUrl": null
      },
      "fileSystem": {
        "enabled": false,
        "retentionInDays": 3,
        "retentionInMb": 35
      }
    }
    ```
    This specifies that the web server logging is disabled for both storage types and consequently, all of the _'Hello World'_ messages are not being stored.

1. Enable Web Serve Logging
    ```shell
    az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem
    ```
    The resulting payload should confirm that <code>httpLogs</code> is enabled for <code>fileSystem</code> storage.

1. Visit the web app and generate more trace messages.

    ```shell
    az webapp browse
    ```

1. Download all activity logs of the web app.
    ```shell
    az webapp log download
    ```
    Unpack the dumped file and view the contents of <code>*_default_docker.log</code> in the <code>/LogFile</code> folder. Expect to see the logs entries include _'Hello World..'_ messages.

    > You can also view the same <code>*_docker.log</code> files via the Kudu Source Control Manager of the web app.
    > ```
    > xdg-open https://$appname.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker
    > ```

## **Clean up**

1. Delete all resources created in the group.

    ```shell
    az group delete --yes
    ```
